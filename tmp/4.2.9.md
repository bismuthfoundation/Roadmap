# Bismuth 4.2.9. Release

After the successful PoW fork of xx/xx/xx, it was about time to release a cleaned up, post fork version of the Bismuth node and wallet.  
That's an opportunity to chat with the architects and dev of the Bismuth project to learn more about what is inside.
Hclivess (Founder, core dev)  and EggdraSyl (core dev) are here to explain.

Q: Hclivess, what is your general stance over Hard forks?


Q: What is a clean up post fork release?

Egg: The fork generally introduce switching rules and 2 versions of the code: what is valid before the fork, and what is valid after.  
this means extraneous, conditional code.  
Once the fork is over, it's good practice to remove dead code and conditions that will no more be triggered.  


Q: But this release also includes new features, why?

Egg: Well, we can't release the clean up version just after the fork. Exchanges and users just have updated, you want to let them rest a bit.  
Also, we devs do continue to work on new features in the mean time.  
We try not to introduce too big changes so we take fewer risks, so this release is mainly a big fixes and incremental changes rather than some huge feature introduction.

Q: One of the features is peers related. Can you explain a bit?

Hclivess:

Q: Also, I saw there were some wallet related commits by Egg?

Egg: Yep. The GUI light wallet is usually not my competence, but it needed a few tweaks to support the new API we rolled out.  
Let me explain:  
Until then, either the walelt was connection to your local node (that, it still can), or was used as a "light wallet".  
That is, it does *not* need any node or local chain, it just connects to an online wallet server, in a safe way: it never sends your private key for instance.  
To achieve that, the wallet needed a list of possible servers.

It becomes more complicated when that list can evolve: one server can be down, or have too much clients, or we can add new servers.  
How to handle that?  
The wallet was benchmarking the known servers - that took some time - but new servers required an update from the users.  
There ought to be a simpler solution.  
This became even more critical with the added post-fork load. More users, more wallets: existing servers were overloaded.

Enters the API. A single API server tests all known wallet servers, and provides a qualified list of all active, up to date, wallet servers with their current load.  
Now, the wallet only is a request away of getting up to date info.  
The team adds a server, it appears in the list, no action from the user.

With this API (**url**), users will now experience a faster wallet, and we are able to scale up or down at will.
