# Roadmap
Dev team roadmap document: this document shows the short-, mid- and long-term development plans of the dev team, as well as bounty projects where contributions from new developers are welcome.  
As activities are completed, they are moved down to the "Completed" list.  
This document should be updated fairly frequently.

> Note: PoW fork on October 8 was not planned in this Roadmap. Needed much research, tests and energy.
Was needed to avoid centralization, see https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/mining-algos/blob/master/Docs/Fork-FAQ.md for more info

> Note2: Dev efforts on the legacy wallet have been postponed due to the new gen "Tornado" Wallet.
